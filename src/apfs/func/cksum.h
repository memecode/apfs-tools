     * APFS uses a variant of the traditional Flecther-64 checksum.
     * See: https://blog.cugu.eu/post/apfs/#checksum
     * 
     * In particular:
     * 
     * - Instead of `simple_sum`, APFS uses `c1`, which (in number theory lingo)
     * is the remainder of `- (simple_sum + second_sum)` modulo `modulus`.
     * 
     * - Instead of `second_sum`, APFS uses `c2`, which (in number theory lingo)
     * is the remainder of  `- (simple_sum + c1)` modulo `modulus`. However, it
     * turns out that this `c2` value always just equals `second_sum` itself,
     * so there is no need to compute `c2`.
     * 
     * This variant of Fletcher-64 means that, when validating against the
     * stored checksum, we just compute the traditional Fletcher-64 checksum of
     * the whole block (including the stored checksum) and the computed value
     * should be zero if the stored checksum is correct.
     * 
     * Here, if we are computing the checksum rather than validating the block
     * against the stored checksum, we compute `c1` and just store it in the
     * variable `simple_sum`.
